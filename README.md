# WhatsApp chat analysis & data visualisation
### WhatsApp chat analysis and data visualisation with sentiment analysis (React, JS)

#### Project:

 - After seeing [this image on _/r/dataisbeautiful_](https://i.redd.it/oz38c0yc8lt31.png) I decided to try my hand at creating a ReactJS app to do the same for myself and to practice computational linguistics
 - In hindsight, I would have preferred to have created this in Python as it would have allowed me to explore the data further using NLP and ML

#### Run instructions:
 - Try it out [on the demo page here](https://jackscanlon.github.io/WhatsAppVisualisation/)
OR
 - Download *chat.txt* file from WhatsApp application on iOS or Android
