# WhatsApp chat analysis & data visualisation
### WhatsApp chat analysis and data visualisation with sentiment analysis (React, JS)

#### Project:

 - After seeing [this image on _/r/dataisbeautiful_](https://i.redd.it/oz38c0yc8lt31.png) I decided to try my hand at creating a ReactJS app to do the same for myself and to practice computational linguistics
 - In hindsight, I would have preferred to have created this in Python as it would have allowed me to explore more NLP and ML techniques

#### Run instructions:
 - Download *chat.txt* file from WhatsApp application on iOS or Android
 - After `npm test` or `npm build` -> select the aforementioned .txt file

*Please note: Does not have group chat functionality*
